# Dices Game Project
Welcome to the Dices Game Project! This simple web application is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows two players to play a game of chance with two dices - simply refresh the page to throw the dices and see who wins!

## How to Play
Open the live demo in your browser.
Both dice are rolled by refreshing the page..
If the number on Dice 1 is higher than the number on Dice 2, Player 1 wins. If the number on Dice 2 is higher than the number on Dice 1, Player 2 wins. If both numbers are equal, the game ends in a draw.
Keep playing and refreshing the page until one player wins.
